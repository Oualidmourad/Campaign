# Campaign
Analyzing data for marketing campaigns I got the data from Growth level and then started pulling it into power bi I started using power query to transform and clean the data and add some basic columns and moved on to the data visualization step to answer the questions, and I used Vector Icon to get the stickers and BBIB website to get the colors.
